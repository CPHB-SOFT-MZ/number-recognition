# number-recognition

## Prerequisites
- ```python3```
- ```tensorflow```
- ```matplotlib```
- ```numpy```

## Guide to run project
Clone this repository to your local machine.

To install the prerequisites, assuming Python 3 is already installed, you can run these commands:

- ```pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow```
- ```pip3 install --upgrade matplotlib```
- ```pip3 install --upgrade numpy```

Then you should be all set to run the project. 
Change the directory to the cloned folder and run the project by typing in the following:

This will produce the most optimized result we've come to in this project.


## Earlier results

The first version of the project was simply a one neuron layer using the softmax function.

The results ended up like this:

This means we start off with an accuracy of approximately 92.2%. This is OK for a start, but it's the last 7.8% that are the toughest. 
Let's take a look.
